    <p>A **Web Application Firewall (WAF)** is a security solution designed to protect web applications from cyber threats by monitoring and filtering incoming and outgoing web traffic. It acts as a **virtual shield**, identifying and blocking malicious activities such as **SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and other hacking techniques** that could compromise sensitive data. By using **behavioral analysis and customizable rule sets**, a WAF not only defends against known attacks but also adapts to emerging threats. Its role is crucial in maintaining **data confidentiality, application availability, and user trust**, making it an essential component of modern cybersecurity strategies.</p>
